# Run! CoCo! Run!

## Inspiration

I simply want to bring a classic web2 game to web3.

## What it does

People will need to own specific NFTs to play this game. Also if people's scores can rank top 3, they will receive tokens every week.

## How we built it

I used Phaser 3 to implement the game, solidity to write contracts.

## What we learned

Not difficult to bring web2 games to web3

## What's next for Run CoCo Run

Will design more NFTs and publish the game to mainnet.
